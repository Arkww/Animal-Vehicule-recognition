# CIFAR10 Image recognition

In my first deep-learning project I learned how to train a model to recognise image using convulutional layers.

I used the CIFAR10 dataset on Kaggle and my goal was to train a model that could recognize pictures of my cat and my car.

I learned a lot about deep-learning technologies and also implemented Cuda in my program !
